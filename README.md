## Description

**MediBot** is an intelligent medical document assistant designed to streamline the process of extracting information from multiple medical PDF files. Users can upload various PDF documents (e.g., patient records, research papers, medical guidelines), and then interact with a chatbot to ask context-specific questions. This allows for quick and efficient retrieval of information contained within the uploaded documents, making it a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, researchers, or anyone needing to navigate large volumes of medical texts.

> ‚öôÔ∏è The GPT-4.1-nano model is accessed using the `euriai.langchain` package, allowing seamless integration with LangChain tools for conversational document QA.
